# VLSI_Booth_Multiplier

## Summary

This project was the culmination of everything we learned in ECEGR 4140 Intro to VLSI Circuit Design class. We created a booth multiplier from the transistor up in VLSI. Making a booth multiplier requires us to first make a lot of other lower-level components, which makes it a perfect final project.
